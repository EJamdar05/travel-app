# WeatherApp

This is the third project in the UDacity Front End Web Dev course. 
In this project, it demonstartes the usage of nodeJS and establishing 
client side code and server side code and how both of these files 
communicate with one another in terms of exhanging information.
## Website Description

This website is a simple page that asks for the user to enter their
zipcode and to enter a message. Once they submit that, a generate button is 
added and when clicked, the info will be collected by the client side code 
and then the zipcode is used to access the temp of the user's zipcode. This
is done via the usage of the OpenWeatherMap api. Once the data is collected, that
data will then be sent to the localserver and can be accessed via a get route.

After the user hits the generate button, a date, the temperature and their comment
is dynamically added to the page

## Instructions

Download the zipfile and run the server.js file via CMD Prompt or Powershell with the correct file path to 
establish the local server.

## Credits

The HTML and CSS code were provided at the hands of the UDacity team and all credit 
goes to them. The server and client side code were written by me. WebAPI data was provided at the hands of OpenWeatherMap.
